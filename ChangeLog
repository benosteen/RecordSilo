    * Version: 0.4.14
    * Passing the file name instead of a file-like object (using StringIO) to the RDFXML parser for unicode support 
    * Passing a unicode string containing non ascii characters as a file object to the parser in rdflib throws UnicodeEncodeError (see http://code.google.com/p/rdflib/issues/detail?id=108). Format of string is XML. This is reproducable even in version 3.1.0 of rdflib. So passing the file name instead to the parser so as to be able to handle the full rnage of unicode characters in the manifest. This seems to work.
